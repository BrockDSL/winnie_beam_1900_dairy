Had a nice rain this
afternoon Butter was
28¢ a lb. Dr Abbott & his
brother from London
drove down & papa was
going with them fishing
but to [sic] much rain afraid of
a duckling [??]. Turned out bright
and clear. Poor men got explore [??]
their fishing and drive. Mamma
& I were uptown in
afternoon. Bough a silver
heart with a maple
leaf in it. The only
thing that worried me was
the 30¢ I paid for it Leta passed.
