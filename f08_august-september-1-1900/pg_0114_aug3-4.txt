Mamma has a sore side today.
I went uptown. Took
library book back and got
"Opening of a Chestnut Burr"
Bought two twin down
Collars at Jnits [??]. Got a box
of long berries. I got a letter
from Bessie Currie yesterday
She will be at her grandma
to-morrow. Put my
aquarium up on the
verandah [??] so we could
see them better.
