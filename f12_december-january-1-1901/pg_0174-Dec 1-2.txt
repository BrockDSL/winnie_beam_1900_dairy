Dec 1
Took my music lesson.
When I went Mr. Read was 
Standing outside pounding
The door and we had to
Wait for about five minutes.
Have “Valse Chromatique” by Leschitzky.
Fixed Eva’s permipers [?]. Then
I called for Beatrice to go uptown
But she had to go to the Dennyson
Club. Got a library book ‘Letters on
Music’ by Ehlert. Bought Eva’s Christmas 
Present “The Twentieth Door, by Sheldon.
Beatrice & I were in to Henderson’s
May ran a needle in her foot. 



Dec 2
Eva was in to show her new
Furs. Went to church.
Sermon XII, 11 verse. A young man
sat in our seat. Eva was over
again with a new hat. Then
I went to Sunday School,
The lesson was on the 
“Rich Young Ruler, Matt 19. Did not
go out at night. We have
new lesson leaflets.
Have pictures on the lesson,
and a short story Road
“The Twentieth Door & Letters for Music.
