Did not do much all day. 
Had quite a small snow 
blizzard in the 
afternoon. Then at night 
mamma and I went 
to the musical. Its first 
meeting for the year. 
Mrs Williams is Editor in 
place of Mr Burrell. The 
first piece was nice “Morsica”
by Oliver King, the second was 
better. Improvisata by Reinecke. 
Mrs Ma[?] & Mrs Chaplin played the 1st 
& Miss Paterson & Miss Chaplin the 2nd.

Mamma had to do to the 
church in the afternoon to 
keep quiet. She was in 
to McLaren about a set of 
dishes. When papa came 
home to supper he had 
a letter from Allie saying 
she cannot play. So I have to. 
Papa went with me. Kate 
Sutton played a valse [waltz] & I played 
Bolero by Jadassohn. Mr McIntyre 
gave a fine lecture on his 
trip. Then I played, “God Save the Queen”. 
I got a little mixed on it. Papa 
& I had to go home with Miss McGibbon. Ella was over at night.
