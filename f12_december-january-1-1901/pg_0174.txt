Took my music lesson.
When I went Mr. Read was 
Standing outside pounding
The door and we had to
Wait for about five minutes.
Have “Valse Chromatique” by Leschitzky.
Fixed Eva’s permipers [?]. Then
I called for Beatrice to go uptown
But she had to go to the Dennyson
Club. Got a library book ‘Letters on
Music’ by Ehlert. Bought Eva’s Christmas 
Present “The Twentieth Door, by Sheldon.
Beatrice & I were in to Henderson’s
May ran a needle in her foot.
