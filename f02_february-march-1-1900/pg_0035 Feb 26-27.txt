It was very cold and I did
not go to school. The Ladies
Home Journal came to-day
The club meets here to-night
They were all here expect
Armstrongs and McGhies.
Mr Pay won the gentleman's
prize Mrs Macgregor the ladies
and Mrs Notman the booby
As we were eating lunch
the cannons started to go
off and we thought Ladysmith was relieved some, Mr Macgregor is
not going to clean his boots until it is relieved.


Tuesday February 27

It was a false report about
Ladysmith, but Cronje had
surrendered. They had a
patriotic concert in the opera
House last night for Red Cross
fund. Mamma went uptown in
afternoon and I went afer
to the Post office and library
I sent for three pieces of 10 cent
music from Denton Cottier & Daniels
Buffalo. They were at the Spring by Liszt
Two Larks by Leschetizby, & Tannhauser
March by Wagner. I got the "Heavenly
Twins" out of the Library. Mamma
got a color cord (Corticelli) and the
colors are grouped so harmoniously
Phoebe got a letter from Jennie Tucker
