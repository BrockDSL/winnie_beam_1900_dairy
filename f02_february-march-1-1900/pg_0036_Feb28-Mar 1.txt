February Wednesday 28 1900 

Last night the boys and men
celebrated Cronje's surrender
by bonfires, firecrackers
and the band played on.
They stole about $50 worth
of boxes from McLarens and
sent in a false alarm to get the
firement out. Mamma went to
church as it is the Ladies Aid
monthly meeting. There she staid [sic]
to the first Lenten service. To-day is
Ashwednesday. Phoebe got a picture
of Edna Potters. It has been snowing
nearly all day. Papa brought some peanuts home.


March Thursday 1(60-305) 

When I awoke this morning the
Meritton whistle was blowing
pretty soon the Town bell then
St George's Chruch chimes so I
knew Ladysmith was relieved
Hurrah! It has been blowing
and snowing Oh! how hard.
It is the worst snowstorm
we have had this year.
Another day in the house.
Mamma strained her wine
to-day. I arranged the pictures
in my room as I had got
tired of them. I found a pretty
picture yesterday in an old
Montreal Star of the Madonna and
Christ child so I put it up
