January Friday 19 1900 

Was at school in the morning
Sat with Leta. Papa came
home from Hamilton last
night. Practiced in afternoon.
Mamma made a very pretty
cushion for parlor. Tapestry front
and brown back. Papa brought
us some candy at night. He
bought three tickets for the
Redpath Concert Co. that is to be
here on Tuesday. Mr Read & Mr
Macgregor are bringing them here.
Wrote a letter to Aunt Allie


Saturday January 20

Took my music lesson. Took
the 7th Etude (as I did not practice
it for this week as I had too
many reviews) and Mendelssohn's
"Fr√ºhlingslied". It was raining
when I went, and has been
raining all day. Mrs Trusty
came to iron through all the
wet. Mamma is making
another cushion. It is of
peacock blue sateen covered
with Battenburg. In my
Harmony I had to work out
from exercises in Open instead
of Close Position.
