<p>Took my music lesson. Took<br />
the 7<small><sup>th</sup></small> Etude (as I did not practice<br />
it for this week as I had too<br />
many reviews) and <a href="/s/ital-iasc-2q90/page/music/#Mendelssohn" onmouseover="showPreview(event)">Mendelssohn&#39;s<br />
&quot;Fr&uuml;hlingslied&quot;</a>. It was raining<br />

raining all day. <a href="/s/ital-iasc-2q90/page/communitymembers#TrustySusan" onmouseover="showPreview(event)">Mrs Trusty</a><br />
came to iron through all the<br />
wet. Mamma is making<br />
another cushion. It is of<br />
peacock blue sateen covered<br />
with Battenburg. In my<br />
Harmony I had to work out<br />
from exercises in Open instead<br />
of Close Position.</p>
