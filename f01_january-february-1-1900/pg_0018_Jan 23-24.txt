<p>Went to <a href="/s/ital-iasc-2q90/page/locations/#CollegiateInstitute" onmouseover="showPreview(event)">school</a> in the afternoon.<br />
Then papa mamma &amp; I went<br />
to the Redpath Concert Co. <a href="http://bmd.stcatharines.library.on.ca/en/3432705/image/3407667">The<br />
concert</a><small><sup>1</sup></small> was fine. I never heard<br />
anything I liked as well. There<br />
were four singers 1 violinist and<br />
1 pianist. Mme Meredith soprano<br />
<a href="/s/ital-iasc-2q90/page/communitymembers#ClaryMaryLouise" onmouseover="showPreview(event)">Miss Clary</a>, contralto. Dr Carl Dufft basso<br />
Mr Town, Tenor, Miss Von Fursch<br />
violinist and Miss Koler pianist<br />
all of them were encored twice<br />
and Mr Dufft three times. All the<br />
ladies got a beautiful boquet.<br />
The first part was <a href="/s/ital-iasc-2q90/page/music#LehmanLiza" onmouseover="showPreview(event)">L[iza]. Lehmann&#39;s &quot;In a Persian Garden&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>Went to school in the morning.<br />
<a href="/s/ital-iasc-2q90/page/communitymembers/#GardinerAnnie" onmouseover="showPreview(event)">Annie Gardiner</a> was not there<br />
<a href="/s/ital-iasc-2q90/page/communitymembers/#DwyerAnna" onmouseover="showPreview(event)">Mrs Dwyer</a> and <a href="/s/ital-iasc-2q90/page/communitymembers/#DwyerBeatrice" onmouseover="showPreview(event)">Beatrice</a> called<br />
in the afternoon. Beatrice and<br />
Percy were at the concert but I<br />
did not see them. Beatrice thought<br />
it was not worth 75&cent; last<br />
night. Well everybody did not<br />
think so or they would not<br />
have encored them as they did.<br />
Mamma finished her Buttenburg<br />
cushion. Hellen was coming<br />
over this afternoon, but she did<br />
not get here.<br />
