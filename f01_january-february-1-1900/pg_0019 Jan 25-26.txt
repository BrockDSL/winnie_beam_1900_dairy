January Thursday 25 1900
Went to school in afternoon, the 
inspector was there, dear [?], I 
did not try to answer questions. 
Mr Henderson lent Miss Dougan 
Miss benson & I his umbrella 
as it was raining hard when 
we came out of school. Ella came
over and brought Dolly [?]
home. She borrowed our rat trap
At night it snowed and blew 
phew! and I could not go to the 
Musical which I was very sorry 
for as it was Russian night & Miss Mc
Farlane played. Pap brought some candy.


Friday 26
We burnt a lamp last night as 
the gaslight [?] are so high. It is very 
nice to burn lamps. Did not go 
to school this morning as it was 
cold & vlustry. 10' below zero.
Mr Carman came over with a 
rat for Parmy to catch it, and 
the night thing wouldn't as the 
rat bit him on the lip. Mamma
