January Tuesday 23 1900 
Went to school in the afternoon. 
Then papa mamma & I went 
to the Redpath Concert Co. The 
concert was fine. I never heard

were four singers 1 violinist and 
1 pianist. Mime Meredith soprano 
Miss Clay contralto[?]. Dr Carl Dufft lasso[?]
Mr Town, Tenor, Miss Von Lunsch 
violinist and Miss Koler pianist 
all of them were encored twice
and Mr Dufft three times. All the

Wednesday 24 
Went to school in the morning. 
Annie Gardiner was not there 
Mrs Dwyer and Beatrice called
in the afternoon. Beatrice and
Percy were at the concert but I 
did not see them. Beatrice thought 
it was not worth 73-c last 
night. Well everybody did not
think so or they would not 
have encored them as they did. 
Mamma finished her Buttenburg 
cushion. Hellen was coming 
over this afternoon, but she did 
not get here.
