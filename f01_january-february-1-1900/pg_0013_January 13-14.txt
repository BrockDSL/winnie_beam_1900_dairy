<p>Did not go to <a href="/s/ital-iasc-2q90/page/locations#StThomas" onmouseover="showPreview(event)">church</a> in the morning<br />
as it is very rainy and sloppy.<br />
Then in the afternoon did not<br />
go to Sunday School as it was<br />
raining harder still. Papa is reading<br />
&quot;<a href="/s/ital-iasc-2q90/page/literature#Kedar" onmouseover="showPreview(event)">in Tents of Kedar</a>&quot;. I have been reading<br />
the Musicains. There is one very good<br />
article on &quot;The Development of Technique<br />
from Bach to Liszt&quot;. We did not<br />
go to church as it was<br />
rainy again. I wish we did not<br />
have rainy Sundays. I finished<br />
&quot;In Tents of Kedar&quot; to-night</p>
