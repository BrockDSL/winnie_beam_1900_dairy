About tweleve o&#39;clock two &nbsp;<br />
women called with a book<br />
they were trying to sell, and<br />
were more bother than their<br />
worth. Mamma &amp; I went<br />
uptown. I took Mr Henderson&#39;s<br />
umbrella home. I bought<br />
three sponge taffy squares as I<br />
had 3 coppers. <a href="/s/Diary-of-Winnie-Beam/page/communitymembers/#OverholtFrank1" onmouseover="showPreview(event)">Mr Overholt</a> came<br />

<p>Papa &amp; Mr Overhold saw Charlie<br />
Gould. Did not go to <a href="/s/Diary-of-Winnie-Beam/page/locations/#StThomas" onmouseover="showPreview(event)">church</a> as<br />
it was after time when we<br />
got up from breakfast. About<br />
12 o&#39;clock Charlie &amp; Mr Dean<br />
a friend of his came down.<br />
When they went to catch 2.45<br />
train Mr Overholt went with<br />
them. Went to Sunday School<br />
The lesson was the<br />
&quot;Temptation of Jesus&quot; Did not<br />
go at night as mamma<br />
said she would go to<br />
sleep as was up so<br />
late last night.</p>
