Friday January 5, 1900

Sweep day. I read "At the Camerons"
in the "Harper's Young People" when
mamma was sweeping. We had
a beggar in afternoon asking for a
few cents as he had a long way
to go. Rats! Went over to Lee's
in afternoon after eggs. Took a
"Young Ladies Journal" Mrs Pay lent
me. Her kitty has a sore
tail. Mrs Malcolmson came after
eggs when I was there. She got
large sum of 2. Had some candy
at night.

Took my music lesson. Mr Read
had not had his breakfast when
I got there so Mrs Campbell
showed me some of Robert
Campbell's sketches. Mr Read
just had 2 new songs he
designed the cover himself for
them. Took the 6th Etude of
Czerny Op 740. Went to Eckhardt's &
got my Mathew's History of Music
& a scribbling pad. Mrs Trusty
was here ironing. Mamma & I
went uptown in the afternoon.
