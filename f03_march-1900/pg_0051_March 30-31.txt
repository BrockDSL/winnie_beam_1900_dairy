Carrie is seriously ill in Santa
Barbara. Mr Gould started there 
on Wednesday. I sent for 
26 picutes from Brown & Co. this
morning. Went uptown when 
mamma was sweeping to 
the Post and Library. Got The
Pursuit of the House Boat,
by John K. Bangs. Laura brought
the buttermilk. Mr Coy wanted
papa to go to the Opera House
to-night. The play is 
"Zaza"[?].
