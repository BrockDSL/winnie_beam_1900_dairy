October 12

Did not practice much
to-day. After dinner
mamma and I
went for a drive. We
drove to [???] and
got a tick[?] and
looking glass out of 
the cottage. Pappa wanted
to take them up
North with him.
Got some very hard
apples on the tree by
cottage


October 18

Took my music IV. of
[???] AP 26. Eva
came over and she is going
to the Falls. Papa and 
mamma started right after
dinner for the twenty. I
washed the dishes and
ironed some small things.
Mrs Trusty did our washing to-day
Then [???] and I went
uptown. She got a slant and 
took [???] to have him 
hamed[?]. Eva bought me a Union
Jack Hatpin from Falls. Mamma
found some lovely apples in the
marsh. I made some candy
with [???] in "Fudge".
