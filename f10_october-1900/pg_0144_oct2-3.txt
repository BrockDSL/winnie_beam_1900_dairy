Eva says she is not going
to school this afternoon
as the whole room is in
for a licking. Mamma and
I drove down to Dusty's[?]
for [???] then to waites
for peony root. When we
came home I dressed went
uptown to library and
got Attila by G.P.R. James no good
And I went to see Ally
she was not home when I
got there but came later.
They have a reception for D. Smith I had
to-night.

Papas office. Papa gave me
a $1.00 I got a book
