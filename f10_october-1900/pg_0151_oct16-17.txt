was over after. Turned 
quite coal. Gave Eva some
fans. I took Mrs [???]

The man came and cleaned
the stoves. The sweet 
potatoes we had last night
went for me. Mamma went
up to the church. I read
"Haran the Hermit" then I
got ready and started. Met
mamma and Mrs Haun[?] at the 
corner. We went to
McJaren's[?] and got goods for 
my green skirt. Then to
Miss Anderson's. Got some 
narrow velvet ribbon for my laing[?]
Met Mrs Pay. I got "When [???]
Was in Flower" at library. Went 
to Keating's after my picture.
Pays have sold their house and we go
there Friday
