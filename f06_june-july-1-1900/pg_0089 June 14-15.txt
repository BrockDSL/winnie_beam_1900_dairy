Ella came over in morning
and mamma showed her 
how to cut a waist by [?]
pattern. Our white roses 
are out. At noon there
was true circles around
the sun and inside of 
the circles was a dark space. MAggie brought 
Pheobie's waist home after
so long a time. Frank Overholt
was here for tea. Had to go
over to Lee's after Supper, Band
Concert.

Frank did not stay but [?]
home last night. I went
uptown to [?] and
Wilsons. Pretty warm 
riding. Mamma & papa 
went out for a drive 
after tea. I had to 
wash the dishes. 
My white [?] dress
and blue waist came
home to - night. She did
not do as mamma wanted 
her to. And my Blue waist 
has the white front on the sutside 
instead of upside of waist.
