June 6
The curtains for the hall & kitchen
windows came this morning. 
The hall ones have lace on,
I finished the "Castle town."
A very good story of its kind 
but they can handly[?] say 
a word without swearing. 
Aunt Lillie and Uncle Horace
came to-night after tea
Papa & Uncle Horace took Ken
up to Murphy's livery
stable.

dinner. Then aunt Lillie &
mamma drove down to 
waite's in the afternoon
after tea Mrs Hairir[?] came 
down. Played some for her
then we all went up 
to hear the first band
concert of the season
They played love[?] new hymms 
from England.
