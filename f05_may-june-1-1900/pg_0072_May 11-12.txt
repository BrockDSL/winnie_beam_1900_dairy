Had our first asparagus 
to-day. It came from Jeeves,
Mamma cleared the little
front room. I planted 
my nasturtium seeds
this afternoon. So did
mamma & Phoebe plant their
seeds. Papa & Mamma 
intended going to Ridley 
College. Assault-at-Arms in 
Masonic Hall, but papa had
to go to Lodge.
