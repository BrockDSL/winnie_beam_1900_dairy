We expected Mrs. J. Overholt and 
Frank[?] in to-day, but tehy 
couldn't get a horse. Mamma
was out there yesterday.
Planted eight little pots with
two masturtins in each. 
Am going to start them for
Aunt Lillie. Mamma went 
collecting, and uptown. She got
a new waist. Papa wanted to 
see my teeth so I went up, but
he had left the office. Mamma & 
Papa were over to Pays[?] at night.
The ladies home Joanna caught[?] day.

I took my music lesson. 23rd 
etude[?]. Mrs. J. Overholt came in
about 10:30 to see me as it 
was her only chance. I wanted
to go out on my bicycle
but they would not let me.
Went up to Miss Sutherlaud's
for a bonnet[?] for Mrs. J. Overholt
as mamma is going to take it out. 
Papa and mamma went out to 
Overholt's Ella was over and
we got 10 two cent stamps instead of 
out flags we sent to Eaton's for
as the flags are all mounted.
Went over to Mr. Larens[?] garden and 
over to Lees worth. Ella she gave me a 
lovely French lilies of the valley. 
Mamma brought home a bag of sweet apples.
