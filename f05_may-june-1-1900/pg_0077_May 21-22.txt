May 21
Went over to Carman's to see
Ella about some flags she 
told me about. Mamma
and I drove to woods after
farms. Got quite a lot of 
them. Ella came over
at night to tell me
about the flags. Gave her
20 cents for 3. Fireburgs
tried to burn Wilson's Lumber
yard Saturday night, and
last night they burnt their
farm with some veggies and 
one horse.
