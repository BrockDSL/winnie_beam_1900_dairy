april 1
Went to church in the 
morning Sermon Matt. 28.19.
It was nice and warm
this morning. Left my cape
off, and put on my jacket to
my green skirt when I 
went to Sunday School. Winnie
Rolls is coming to the Bible
class. The lesson was the 
"Beatitudes". Papa went for a
walk. Mr. Coy went with him.
Papa, mamma, and I went
to church at night. I think the 
serman was "The Soul, its flight
outward & upwards". Mr Kimberley
sang.

but was misty. papa and 
I intended gaoing to the
concert in the Queen St.
Baptist Church. But it was
raining harder than ever,
Mrs Reas Muir was the first 
on the programme. They had
the Halleluyah chores of 
Handel's. Mattie Coy and Mrs
Van Dusen[?} were in an
actette.
