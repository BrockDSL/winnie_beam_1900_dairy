April 19
Mamma went collecting this
afternoon, and I was to
meet her uptown. Took a
net doily to Winnie. I went to 
office and waited for mamma.
We went to Anderson's Had two
hats sent down. Papa mamma,
and I went to the "Little Minister".

minister had a queer head. Babbie
was pretty. Mr Ira A. Hards took
the part of Cavin [sic] Dishart the minister
and Adelaide Thurston Lady Babbie. 
Got some medicine from Cincinnati.
