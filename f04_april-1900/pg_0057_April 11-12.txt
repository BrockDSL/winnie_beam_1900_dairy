Mrs Trusty is sick so we had a 
Miss Freeman to was. Early in 
the afternoon I went over to Dwyer's
and asked Beatrice to go with
me to Granite Hall to practice m peace
We went, and I came home
with her. Then she came
home with me for tea
We played eurchre, and 
beat all but one game Papa
went to Thorold. Perry came
after Beatrice. They leave some
violets out, and they smell
like spring. Raining hard.

Went over to Lee's in morning
looks like rain. We were
to have our ironing done
but she had to go to S. Smith's
to wash. Mamma and I went 
to Musical at night. Mrs camp
led to-night. Mrs marquis was 
the only married person on the 
programme (nearly all Misses). Bella
Kilner played "Moment Musical"
by Scharwenka. The best one
was a Pondo[?] for two pianos
by Chopin. Miss Paterson first
piano and Mrs Marquis
the second. I think I go
through mine alright.
