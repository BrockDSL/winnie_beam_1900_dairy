July 30
Annie Trusty was here to tell
us her mother will come
to-morrow instead of Wednesday.
She is very anxious about
those stamps so in the
afternoon I went over to
Durnin's [?] after soap & sugar
then up to the stamps store
to see if they were going
to stop taking books after
Aug first. They are. Leta, Grace
Woods & Nell Lloyd were down
at night. Leta wants me to
go to a wheeling party tomorrow night.

Mrs Trusty washed. Wood Bros.
are giving triple stamps
to-day. If I had only waited
to get my slippers, but I was
not fooled as I needed a
pair of rubbers. Got 18 stamps.
Went to Dudley's to tell her
I couldn't go to the wheeling
part but I would come about 9
to the house. Nellie Lloyd called
for one. They rode to Homer. Dud
not get back until after 9. Had
ice cream & cake. Mr Reed came home
with me. The King of Italy
(Humbert) has been assassinated
The Queen's son Duke of Saxe-Cobourg
Gothia [sic] is dead.
