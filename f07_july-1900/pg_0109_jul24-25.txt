July 24
I went collecting for Mamma.
Was to Mrs Reynolds,
Coy's and Mrs Smith's. Got the
money at every place
Was at Mrs Smith's quite a
while. Then went up to
Wilson's. They drove out
to Overholt's with three
large bass, Lizzie was
down, and Ella brought us
a lovely bunch of sweet 
peas. Got "Ladie's Home Journal
