tabourette: (also spelled tabouret or taboret) refers to two different pieces of furniture: a cabinet or a stool. The popular sense refers to a small portable stand or cabinet, with drawers and shelves for storage. It is used as a method to bring organization to a work area. As a stool, it refers to a short stool without a back or arms. The name is derived from its resemblance to a drum (diminutive of Old French tabour).[1]
