September 20

Nasty gloomy day. Mr
Mc sloy [?] sent papa live
trout from Quebec. Had 
them Tuesday night.
They tried to stop the 
ringing of the 6, 2,5,+6 [?]
bells. Crazy.



September 21

Helped dust. In the afternoon
we hurried around and
went uptown. Mamma went
collecting and then went
to Mr Chatfield's. I went
to the office and watched 
for her. Nellie [???]
in the office. The Collegiate
games were to-day.
[???] won the race.
We were at [???] to
see the hats. We had
two sent down.
