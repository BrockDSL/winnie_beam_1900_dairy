Grandpa went uptown
in the morning. Then 
in the afternoon mamma
drove him down to waites 
I made him some candy
and he went on the
5-o'clock car. The Ladies
Home Journal came to-day.
It has a story entitled "The Story
of a Young Man" by Clifford Howard
It is a story of Christ. Eva
wrote me a letter and I
answered it to-night.
