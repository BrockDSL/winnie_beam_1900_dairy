Canned peaches (Mountain
Rose) and Mr Dow brought
us a basket of the blue
Damson plums. Eva brought
her scrap-book over. I took
some plums over to Carman's
Ella was incapitated [sic]. Allie
was over. Took her with
us uptown as were all
ready then she came back
with us. She has made 
a mash of a millionaire. Got
"The Trial" by C. Young. I think
is is no good.
